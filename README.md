Team Name

Team Member

Yiqiu Shen (Artie) (ys1001)

I am a second-year MSDS student from NYU CDS. Before joining NYU, I worked as a software engineer at Two Sigma Investments. At NYU, I have been working on a cancer detection model that predicts the BI-RAD label for breast mammograms.  

Reason for Team Up

I am interested in the application of deep learning on medical imaging. I have taken courses in deep learning and have done research on the same direction. I would like to continue my research as part of my captone project.

Top 3 Project Choices

1st: CDS Capstone, Breast Cancer Detection with Recurrent Attention Model

2nd: CDS Capstone, Breast Cancer Screening

3rd: CDS Capstone, Interpretable Model for Breast Cancer Detection

Notes

If solo-team is not preferred, I would like to team up with Jingyi Su (js5991) and Nan Wu and form a team of 3ppl. If possible, we would like to merge the 3 single-person projects in the project choices section and take on this merged project. Thanks!
