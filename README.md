Yiqiu Shen (Artie) (ys1001)
I am a second-year MSDS student from NYU CDS. Before joining NYU, I worked as a software engineer at Two Sigma Investments. At NYU, I have been working on a cancer detection model that predicts the BI-RAD label for breast mammograms.  

Reason for Team Up
I am interested in the application of deep learning on medical imaging. I have taken courses in deep learning and have done research on the same direction. I would like to continue my research as part of my captone project.
